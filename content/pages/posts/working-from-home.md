users (YouTube, [WhatsApp](https://chat.whatsapp.com/CPhprZCJ35e3Z193R4WAo6), Facebook, WeChat, Instagram) in the world of the

While Google is still the best site navigator, you can not
ignore the number of users and numbers listed above. Turning to social media to
attract more traffic is a worthwhile investment - if you play the cards right.

If you want to use social media channels to increase site traffic and turn social networks into rich sources of website traffic, join [TargetedWebTraffic.com](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/) in this article. Of course, the work of SEO and trying to rank in Google is
easier. It means trying to rank your site. This does not mean that you have
ever done something in vain, especially if you do not own a big and famous brand.
But if you did it because others did it, then the question arises, why did you
really take on such a challenge?

## Increase Website Traffic Through Social Networks

 

Let's take a look at how to attract social media traffic to
your website.

*Prepare your social media pages*

Obviously, you need to be there before you can drive traffic
from your target media to your site. But the details of this presence are not
very clear. There are elements that strengthen the foundations of your social
presence.

### Your own personal pages

Which do you prefer:

A. talking to a person.

B. Or with a brand account that has only one logo?

 

Most people choose option A 100% of the time. This method
makes interactions more personal and builds more trust.

After selecting the social platform, you want to use, set up
and specify your personal accounts with your name and face there. (If you
already have an account that is great!) Be your own representative. Encourage
others on your team to do the same.

In addition, personal pages should create a network for you
and expand that network, but we will get there later…

### Your business pages

Personal agent makes it easier to direct users to your site
pages. Especially Aynflvynsr ofFacebook often goes beyond the business page
section and just posts everything under its own name. But you probably haven't
reached that point yet, so you need to set aside separate pages to promote your
site (brand).

The first step to increasing site traffic is to create pages
and fill them with as much information as possible.

### Social network influencers

Users' initial impressions of the page often remain forever.
Here are some things your pages should follow to make a good initial impression
on the viewer:

·      Unique name

·      Unique logo

·      URL with the name of your
site

·      Cover image

·      What your site is and what
it does (usually in the About Us section)

·      Contacts

·      [Link to your site](https://www.seo25.com/)

Images that show the essence of your site in the gallery
section

Remember to share your business page updates on your own
pages and ask your co-workers to do the same!

## Platform designed to increase website hits you use

Anyone can name a few great social platforms without
thinking: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, Quora and
more. Using each of them to promote the website and increase site traffic is
safe and risk-free. In fact, as long as your content is relevant to them, there
is no reason not to choose them.

*However, some platforms may require a more subtle approach
than others. for example:*

·      Reddit users know ads. So a
brand's ads are often ignored and hidden.

·      Twitter is known for its
writing limitations.

·      Quora is a question and
answer platform where sponsored articles may be questioned.

#### Updates you post

There are billions of users in the world, but your target
audience will be only a small part of the whole. Design your updates to connect
with the people you want to bring to your site.

Do you know your audience well? What kind of content do they
like the most? There is probably more than one answer to this question, and the
answers can be "funny" or "professional." You may have to
experiment with several different emotions to find the best solution.

There are only two things that work for almost all users,
" show user interest " and " attract attention ". These two
works well for everyone, but only you, as the parent can know for sure.

### Prepare the content inside the site before attempting to increase site&#xA;traffic

Let's remember the number one rule of increasing site
traffic : content is king. Appropriate content within the site as well as to
promote social media have an obligation to be.

Imagine this scenario: Users visit your social media page
and click on a link to one of your updates. This update directs them to the
site, the visitor sees your content but does not think the content is good.
What do you think will happen at this moment? You must have guessed right:
users will leave the site and will never click on another link on your social
media.

### We should not have such a situation.

Traffic absorption That means both attracting new users and
retaining old ones. For the latter, the most important thing is to pay
attention to the quality of your content. If it is to change, it must change
only for the better.

### Drive social media users to your site

Well, the foundations are now laid. It is time to start
generating traffic and increase site traffic. the more, the better.

Post more

Users receive many posts from different sources in their
feed or feed. The more these posts are about you, the better your chance of
getting clicks. Post on your page at least several times a week, Even if you
can send several posts in one day.

Of Media for Per Use

It will be more interesting if you can post content beyond
the text and image. Most platforms also support many other formats such as
video, polls, and slideshows. You can even get creative with the usual and
"boring" types of content and turn them into something more fun, like
a game.

### Share the content of others.

By doing this, not only will the authors of this content
appreciate what you have done, but they will also receive a notification on
their page and get to know your brand.

### Re-post your content

This works amazingly well, as most social media users lose
some posts. Of course, it is better not to take risks and change your content a
little more than before, so that users who have already visited it have a
reason to click on it again.

### Ask users to link to your posts

Even something as simple as "subscribe to more
posts" will work, but it certainly doesn't hurt to think about it.

### Participate in discussions

The more people talk about what you post, the better, and of
course you are allowed to comment. In addition, users may have questions that
only you can answer.

### Respond quickly to users

A quick response is a sign of importance. Of course, you can
not be active day and night to respond to all, so you can from one chatbot use.

### Expand your social network

In social media, you or anyone you know, the size of something
(knowledge) that you know is important. Always find new friends and followers
and never stop. You can find them on your pages, but there are countless others
on other pages. How many new people have you talked to today?

### Do what your competitors do

After all, there has to be someone who interacts more with
you on social media. Although high interaction is not a ranking factor, it is
often correlated with high rankings on Google. For example, the following tools
can help you find serious competitors.

## Social media traffic 

It shows you who gets more social interaction than you do.

In this case, you can check their pages and see how they
work. Is this interaction due to the updates they post? Is it because of the
time intervals that they post? Or maybe they have a better network of followers
and contacts than you?

### Invest In Advertising To Increase Site Traffic.

You cannot avoid mentioning ads in the field of generating
social media traffic and increasing site traffic. When all else fails (or
even succeed), budget for paid advertising.

people in equal conditions. There is no better place to reach your target
audience. The more users and the better your relationship with them, the more [social
