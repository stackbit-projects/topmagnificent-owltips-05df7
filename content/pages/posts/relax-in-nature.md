# &#xA;What is the meaning of FOMO technique?&#xA;

Have you ever been anxious and worried about losing something?!
FOMO, or the fear of losing, can apply to anything. Today, marketing
professionals use this feeling, which is present in most people, for the
benefit of businesses. In this article, we are going to talk about the full use
of the FOMO technique in digital marketing. 

The word FOMO stands for [Fear of Missing out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out). As we mentioned in the previous section, this fear can be created in anyone and
about anything. These days, creating a sense of fear of loss for the audience
has become very common in marketing. In the FOMO technique, a message is sent
to the recipient stating that the opportunity to buy a particular product has
been lost. This message can be sent via email, text message, information on the
store website or in any other way. People who experience the fear of losing a
lot of things will no doubt be impressed by this marketing method and will be
persuaded to buy!

## History of FOMO technique

The feeling of fear of giving has always been
institutionalized in human beings since the beginning of human history. So, this
feeling is not something new that has just been created! But the study of fomo has
been done scientifically in recent decades. The study project was first started
in 1996 by a marketing strategist named Dr. Dan Herman. The use of this sales
technique became widespread and obvious when social media came into being.

## Why is the FOMO technique used in digital marketing?

Research on the impact of using this technique on sales
shows that marketers have achieved good results from using fomo. But really,
what is the reason that this technique can help sell products?! Here are some
statistics about fomo.

·      
69% of people are afraid of
losing on a daily basis!

·      
60% of people buy products
they do not need because of the feeling of fomo!

·      
Fifty-six percent of people
with Fomo Syndrome have social media, which means that these platforms are very
valuable for using Fomo.

Get acquainted (gain, obtain) with present-day techniques
that came from Fomo Marketing

Businesses and marketing professionals use different methods
to encourage their target community to buy their products or use their
services. In the following, we will explain some of the most effective of these
methods.

### Show that many people are shopping!

One of the most effective ways to evoke a sense of humor in
your audience is to show them that many people are buying and if they do not
hurry, they may lose the product they want forever!

### Highlight missed opportunities!

Highlighting missed opportunities means, for example, not
removing products that have expired or discounts that have expired but showing
them to your audience with striking colors and fonts. By using this method, you
will arouse the feeling of regret in the users of your site. This causes them
to make their purchases sooner for fear of missing existing opportunities.

### Show the bottom of your warehouse!

One of the main components of fomo marketing is scarcity. In
fact, you should give your audience the feeling that their desired product or
service is running out and is in short supply. This way you will be able to
motivate your customers a lot. There are many ways to show deficiency. One
obvious example of a deficiency is the Amazon site. This site shows some of the
items left in stock to encourage the user to buy.

### Get visitors to watch the time

Another factor to consider in the FOMO technique is time and
urgency. If you make your users feel like they're missing out on a chance to
have their favorite product, they're more likely to buy!

### Stimulate the competitive spirit of your audience

In general, a large percentage of people are not only
reluctant to miss an opportunity, but also hate being overtaken by others and
seizing their opportunity! This is why fomo advertising campaigns create a
sense of competition, forcing the audience to buy.

### Restrict free shipping

It is interesting to know that the motivation of a large percentage of users to buy is to send their desired online store for free! This
is one of the reasons why Fomo's advertising campaigns offer free shipping with limited time. A clear example of this method is the store site of Targeted Web Traffic. Most likely, you have bought additional products at least once when buying from [targetedwebtraffic.com](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/?p=56) so that you can use the opportunity of free shipping. In fact, in this situation, people think that if they buy less, they will lose the opportunity
to send for free

#### Be clear about fomo

There is no need to hide the use of fomo sales technique!
You can use this technique in suitable conditions and even inform your
customers about its use!

### Content expiration alert

Most content strategies are about generating content that
stays sustainable around us. You can use such content to build authority,
inbound links, improve SEO rankings and attract customers. But in the meantime,
there is another way to get users' attention by using the fomo technique to
give the content an expiration date. Expiring content combines urgency,
scarcity and monopoly to increase the fear of giving in business.

The final word

In today's world, many marketing methods have been developed by experts in this field. Most of these methods use psychological techniques to
try to convince the audience to buy. One of the marketing methods that is done according to the fear of losing is called FOMO technique. In this technique, using different methods, the fear of giving a product or service of a business is created in users and thus users are satisfied with the [purchase website traffic](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/) now.
